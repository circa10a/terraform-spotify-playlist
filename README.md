# üç¶ mcbroken-spotify-playlist üéÉ

Create a spotify playlist depending how many McDonald's ice cream machines are broken in my city, Dallas.

Implement your own by following the [Hashicorp tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/spotify-playlist).

## About the code

The created tracks in the playlist created by this Terraform code is limited by the number of broken ice cream machines in Dallas, TX thanks to my [mcbroken provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/circa10a/mcbroken/latest/docs) that builds on [mcbroken.com](https://mcbroken.com)

Example, if 11% of McDonald's ice cream machines are broken in Dallas, then guess what, you get 11 tracks. Sorry, not sorry.

```hcl
Outputs:

dallas_broken_ice_cream_machines_percentage = "11.11%"
number_of_tracks = 11
tracks = toset([
  "09pk0cfDQhjtApRPV6VcdO",

## About the playlist

I absolutely hate Summer. It's miserable in the South. So to create a false placebo of everything not sucking around me and that Autumn is so close, I created a playlist full of Halloween songs/sounds. üéÉ

But why? Well, I have an elaborate Halloween IOT project in the works ... and because most of my favored music is pretty explicit by nature ü§ò

Stay tuned for the IOT write-up on my [dev.to profile](https://dev.to/circa10a)

## Requirements

- Docker + docker-compose
- Terraform 1.0+

## Usage

```bash
# Start local oauth-proxy
docker-compose up -d
# Get API key and Auth URL
docker logs spotify-oauth-proxy
# Next, hit the Auth URL to cache an access token in the local server
# Set the API key that was output in the logs for terraform to use
export TF_VAR_spotify_api_key=<api key>
# Install providers
terraform init
# Create the playlist
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
